    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Watching my son struggle with eczema was heartbreaking. We tried everything creams, prescriptions, home remedies</p>
    <p>but nothing worked. His skin stayed dry, inflamed, and irritated.</p>
    <p>Nothing worked for him. So I did research for 6 weeks to find ways to treat his eczema</p>
    <p>Determined to help him, I spent six weeks researching the best natural treatments.</p>
    <p>Finally, I discovered a formula that worked. The first time he used it, his skin looked calmer, and for once, he felt relief.</p>
    <p>That’s why I created Eczema Free</p>
    <p>—a lotion designed to help others find the relief my son did. If nothing has worked for you, this just might.</p>
    <p>We are dedicated to providing natural solutions to eczema relief</p>

    <p>This simple solution works for your skin</p>
